          <h2>Why I Built VanishInk</h2>
          <p>
            During hackathons and tech events, I noticed a common problem: developers needed to share code snippets, 
            API keys, or configuration files quickly, but were hesitant to exchange personal contact information 
            with strangers. WhatsApp groups and email exchanges felt intrusive for temporary collaborations.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created VanishInk to solve this - a platform where you can share technical content instantly without 
            the baggage of permanent connections. No sign-ups, no personal data exchange, just pure, focused 
            collaboration that respects everyone's privacy.
